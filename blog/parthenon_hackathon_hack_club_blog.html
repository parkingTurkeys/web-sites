        <h1>I Went To Parthy!!!!!</h1>
        <h2>2025-11-14, EST 9:56</h2>
        <p>We arrived at Parthenon at 3:30-45~ [can't remember exactly when :hs:] and immediately voted in the November 2025 Hack Club Parliament Elections — the ballot design was super cool! No you are not getting our vote but also WHAT'S WITH THE PHP HATE KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
        <p>uh so! We already had a team sort of planned out [@vook and Mian who's username i forgor] so we hung out with them a bit, also we got a clicker!</p>
        <p>After setting up our stuff, we were supposed to go to Duolingo. With like 9~ other people we went on the train to the Duolingo offices, stopping by the 9/11 memorial fountain on our way there.</p>
        <p>Before getting into the Duolingo offices [fun fact duolingo's japanese twitter account is a hanasato minori fan!!!! also other fun fact minori's va voices march 7th in hsr's japanese dub!!!!!!!!! march 7th is so floof and so is minori!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!] we first had to show our IDs. My passport has a photo from 2022, so when we were ten. Ten-year-old us looks very different and also was basically a different person, so that was strange.</p>
        <p>The food at Duolingo was actually surprisingly good and we ate a metric ton [/j] of chocolate from the chocolate fountain. GAY. And we have a clicker now as well >:333</p>
        <p>anyway</p>
        <p>after getting back...</p>

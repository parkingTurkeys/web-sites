        <p>So, I made a website. It looks really bad but that's the point so I think it's fine. I am also terrible at writing blog posts so this should be fun?</p>
        <p>It started as my <a href = "boba.hackclub.com">Boba Drops</a> website, but then I thought I would remake it <s>because I needed a <a href = "shipwrecked.hackclub.com">Shipwrecked</a> project</s> because I thought it could be better and it was fun to make</p>
        <p>Anyways, I made it and surprisingly, I kinda like the styling (minus the colors)! Also Lynx>>>>>></p>
        <p>It was like a lot of fun and I enjoyed it a lot! It also made me more motivated to do other projects!</p>

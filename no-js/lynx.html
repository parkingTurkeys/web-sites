        <div id="essay" class="text"><p></p><h2 style="color: red;">WARNING: THIS INFO PROBABLY DOES NOT APPLY IN REALLY HARD ENDGAME MODES AND STUFF SINCE I DON'T PLAY THEM :DDD</h2><p></p><p></p><h2 id="in_game">In Game</h2><i>This is basically misinformation, the other sections are a bit better</i><p></p><p>Lynx is actually a powerful healer in-game, even if a lot of people say that 'GaLlAgHeR iS wAaAaAaY bEtTeR tHaN lYnX.' Lynx's skills can be very useful, specifically for certain scenarios.</p><p></p><h3 id="ultimate">Ultimate</h3><i> or: not turn restricted healing</i><p></p><p>Lynx's Ultimate is an essential part of her character design and kit. While other <span title="Gallagher">less cool healers</span>, might have a <b>damaging</b> Ultimate, Lynx's Ultimate is basic, and therefore <i>very useful</i>.</p><p>It '[d]ispels 1 debuff(s) from all allies and immediately restores their respective HP by an amount equal to 9%—14.4% of Lynx's Max HP plus 90—400.5.'<sup class="cite"><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>This is useful in several scenarios. For example, you could use it if some of your characters have <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Effect#Types">crowd control effects</a> (freeze, entanglement, etc.) so that they can attack sooner. It might even be doable, if you have her <a href="#e2">second eidolon</a>, to heal Lynx with her skill every few turns; this way she would have an <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Effect#Debuff_Immunity">Effect Resist</a>. This would be useful in that then she could use her Ultimate to remove effects from the other characters.</p><p>This is feasible due to the fact that her Ultimate actually charges fairly quickly. You may think this means that Lynx has abilities that regain high amounts of Energy, or a particularly low Energy cost. Her Energy cost is on the lower side at 100 (The highest is Aglaea at 350; the lowest are Natasha and Argenti, however most 4 stars seem to hover around 100 to 120), but her skills are the default Energy regeneration rate--her Basic Attack regenerates 20 and her Skill regenerates 30.</p><p>The real difference about Lynx's mechanics are that [unlike <i title="Gallagher">some other characters</i>], her Basic Attack kind of sucks. It does 25-55% of her Max HP as damage.<sup class="cite"><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> Actually, this <i>does</i> do more damage than Natasha's basic attack at Level 0<sup class="cite"><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup><i>(On another note, why is Natasha supposed to be a really good fighter and healer in canon but she sucks in-game?)</i>, and would presumably scale well seeing as her healing is also done as percentages of Max HP. </p><p>Why is this good? Well, it's not really about the actual quality of the attack, but more that it means that you are more likely to use her Skill. I usually heal with Lynx at <i>least</i> every other turn, and that's only in fights where my characters aren't taking too much damage. Anyways, if you're doing that and healing every other turn, without any sort of buff on energy regeneration and without getting attacked, it'll take you... (5+)30+20+30+20=100 ... 4ish turns to regenerate her Ultimate. This is not even including Energy from being hit by attacks. </p><p></p><h3 id="skill">Skill</h3><i> or: Debuff Resist, Aggro, Max HP increase, <span title="not Herrscher of Thunder">HoT</span>, and Sardines<p></p></i><p>Lynx's skill is a pretty default Abundance skill. It heals<sup>tm</sup> a single ally target. However, it also has some special effects.</p><p>First, the most obvious: <s>Herrscher of Thunder</s> Healing over Time (abbreviated as HoT from here one). This means that to receive most of the healing, the characters who were healed need to take a turn. Lynx's HoT persists for 2 turns, which increases to 3 after you get one of her Bonus Abilities. It heals the target by '2.4%—3.8% of Lynx's Max HP plus 24—106.8 at the start of each turn'. This is even more if used with the skill, since when 'Survival Response' is present, her HoT heals the target by '3%—4.8% of Lynx's Max HP plus 30—133.5' HP.</p><p>Next, her Max HP increase. Lynx's skill increases the target ally's Max HP while <i>also</i> healing them. This means that even if a character is at max health, you can still heal them!</p><p>Also, her <a href="#e2">second eidolon</a> grants characters with 'Survival Response' (the effect given to an ally healed with her skill) the ability to resist a debuff. This means if you heal a character and then they get attacked, the first debuff that they get is ignored.</p><p>Another thing about Lynx that I might even call one of her <i>most important</i> attributes is her 'Aggro' increase. 'Aggro' is a fanmade term to describe the likelyhood of a character being attacked. When Lynx heals a Destruction or Preservation character, their's goes up. This is bad if you don't want it, but good if you do :)</p><p>Also Sardines. This doesn't mean anything special, but her animation is cute :3</p><p></p><h3 id="technique">Technique</h3><i> or: Gallagher's is probably better tbh</i><p></p><p>Idk what to say here but it kinda is :(</p><p>At least Lynx's works on bosses? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p><p></p><h3 id="talent">Talent</h3><i> or: basically just <span title="not Herrscher of Thunder">HoT</span><p></p></i><p>idk what to say this is just her healing over time skills</p><p></p><h2 id="eidolons">Eidolons</h2><i> or: uh: i: d: k:D<p></p></i><p></p><h3 id="e1">Eidolon 1</h3><i> Healing rate increases on characters with less than 50% of their HP</i><p></p><p></p><h3 id="e2">Eidolon 2</h3><i> A character healed with her skill gets a Debuff Resist</i><p></p><p></p><h3 id="e3">Eidolon 3</h3><i> Basic Attack and Skill are leveled up</i><p></p><p></p><h3 id="e4">Eidolon 4</h3><i> A character healed with her skill gets higher ATK for 1 turn</i><p></p><p></p><h3 id="e5">Eidolon 5</h3><i> Ultimate and Talent are leveled up</i><p></p><p></p><h3 id="e6">Eidolon 6</h3><i> The Max HP increase from her skill is increased</i><p></p><p></p><h2 id="character">Character</h2><i> or: everything else</i><p></p><p>Lynx's character interactions, story, and design are, in my opinion, better than Gallagher's.</p><p></p><h3 id="personality">Personality</h3><i> or: ! this user is not available right now</i><p></p><p>Lynx's personality is just fun! Her bio when you text her is literally '[warning exclamation point] This user is not available right now'! It's really cute~ Also, she is fandom nerd :3</p><p>She and Pela [:3c :3c :3c :3c :3c :3c] both enjoy a series called 'Tales of the Winterlands'. Interestingly enough, until the conclusion of the Belobog story, it was apparently banned so that it didn't encourage people to leave the city. At one point, Lynx texts you saying (very excitedly) that she got a Tales of the Winterlands fanbook, which suggests that it was probably unbanned.</p><p></p><h3 id="yuri">Yuri</h3><i> or: :33333333333333333333333333333333333</i><p></p><p>There is yuri :3c</p><p>Lynx's Companion Quest is... very straight and heterosexual [/j]. Basically, her older sister gets you to spy on her because she's worried about who Lynx is planning to meet on the Snow Plains. Then you spy on her and Pela <s>having a date</s> going camping together. The story is actually way more emotional, but that part is more about Pela, and this is a page about Lynx.</p><p>Also, she has a cute <a href="https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Cone">Light Cone</a> with her and Pela!

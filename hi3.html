                "Basically, in the start you play as Kiana Kaslana. Something important about this is that, unlike some other gacha games, she is <i>not</i> a self insert.",
                "There is a force called the Honkai. It corrupts people and creates monsters--if you've played HSR, it is somewhat similar to Stellarons/the Fragmentum.",
                "<h2>Really fun things about HI3</h2>",
                "The fighting is pretty fun! If you're on a computer, you might want to play with the controls a bit. It focuses a lot more on dodging. [I've heard that in Genshin, dodging is basically impossible--here, if you don't dodge, you won't be able to survive]",
                "Unlike other games [HSR], characters have <i>multiple</i> 'battlesuits'. This means the story focuses much more on a few characters over a longer period of time, instead of switching focus a lot so they can sell more of the new characters.",
                "Also, until a certain point, chapters are replayable! There is also a skip button.",
                "You get trial characters after Chapter VI [6], so the gacha isn't <i>required</i>",

                "Right now, HI3 takes up over 50GB of storage--I would suggest having a <i>lot</i> of storage. Also, the anticheat means that it needs admin access.",

                "<b>1. Don't pull until at least 2 weeks have passed.</b> This is very important, you want to know what characters you want! Also, never spend crystals on Dorm Supply. Also, don't pull on starter supply. ONLY PULL ON DEDICATED SUPPLY!!! you <i>will</i> regret it.",
                "2. Apparently, Valkyries/Battlesuits need their weapons to function and also you should always use supports (I'm terrible at teambulding so idk)",
                "3. Starter's Manual lasts for 90 days. Do it. If it asks you to skip ahead in the story, either speedrun the story or speedrun that part and watch it on YouTube later.",
                "4. Do dorm errands every day! They can give good  rewards. Overall, whenever there's a red dot, click on it.",
                "5. If you want to be really hardcore and get a lot of crystals, then google stuff, I suck at this :)",
                "6. <b>USE A STORY GUIDE LIKE SERIOUSLY I'M NOT JOKING</b> <a href = 'https://hoyostans.be/explore/honkai-impact-3rd/story-guide-hi3/'>This one is good!</a>",
                "7. Save crystals for a character you like! ",
                "8. Seriously, unless you feel like it, most of the stuff is optional--the story can be played without interacting with most other things!",
                "9. If you want to play the visual novels, there are fan translations linked in the story guide--however, if you want one that works in portrait mode, I made something--it's still a bit broken but it works! : <a href = https://parkingturkeys.github.io/hi3-vn-reader/online.html>https://parkingturkeys.github.io/hi3-vn-reader/online.html</a>",
                "<h2>Extra notes</h2>",
                "HI3 is set in the same overall universe as HSR and maybe Genshin[?], but it's very confusing. Welt in HSR is the same Welt [Yang not Joyce] as in HI3, however all other characters just happen to look alike."

The Honkai was created alongside civilization, and creatures known as the "Honkai beasts", deadwalkers, as well as a paranormal humanoid - The Herrscher - were born within it.

To fight the Honkai invasion, mankind created an organization, called the Schicksal. This organization was assembled by mankind as a means of resistance against the Honkai. Its creation also marked the beginning of a war, an eternal battle where no side has claimed victory. The fighting has continued to this day...

Up until year 2013, when the 3rd Honkai War broke out in eastern Nagazora... `, explanation: "This is a good introduction"},
